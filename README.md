# WhatsApp Warm-up Bot

This repository contains a Python script designed to warm up WhatsApp numbers by simulating a conversation between two numbers. The purpose is to prevent potential bans when sending messages on a large scale in the future.

## Prerequisites and Setup

Before running the script, make sure to have Python, Selenium, and ChromeDriver installed. Configure an Excel file with phone numbers in the file bot_numbers.xlsx and adjust the messages in the script as needed.

## Execution

Run bot_warmup_whatsapp.py to start the script, which will open two Chrome windows, sending random messages between the numbers provided in the Excel file. The time between messages can be adjusted as needed.

## Customization

Personalize the script by modifying messages, adjusting waiting times, and incorporating additional functionalities as needed.
